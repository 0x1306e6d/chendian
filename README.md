The chendian (`change` + `endianness`) is an online endianness converter to
convert the endianness of hex string into short, int, long, float and double
interactively. It supports mobile compatibility to help you convert hex string
in any device from smart phone to desktop.

We use React.js to build single page application with Material-UI components.
Even though there is only one state, we use Redux to manage the state more 
easily. You can see UI related React components in `src/component` and Redux
related module in `src/action` and `stc/reducer`.

We deploy release in GitHub Pages. You can see in `gh-pages` branch.
